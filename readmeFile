these steps to accomplish the task:

Set up the Development Environment:

Choose a microcontroller platform, such as ESP32 with FreeRTOS, or any other microcontroller that suits your preference.
Set up the necessary software development tools and libraries for your chosen microcontroller platform.
Install any required SDKs or APIs for handling network communications and storing data.
Network Communication:

Use the appropriate libraries or APIs provided by the microcontroller platform to establish a network connection.
Implement logic to download the latest data from the given API when the system starts.
Handle API failures by checking the response status and implementing appropriate error handling mechanisms. In case of failure, use the stored persistent data as a fallback option.
Persistent Storage:

Utilize the SD card or any other persistent storage option available on your chosen microcontroller platform.
Implement logic to store the downloaded data onto the persistent storage.
Ensure that the data is stored securely and can be accessed reliably.
Query Functionality:

Implement the functionality to accept user input (typing a key) through the console or any other input method available on your microcontroller.
Use the stored data to look up the corresponding value based on the provided key.
Print the value to the console along with the query time.
Handle Border Cases:

Take into consideration any border cases, such as handling invalid input, handling situations where the stored data is missing or corrupted, or handling scenarios where the API response is slow.
Testing and Documentation:

Test your code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and handle any potential issues or bugs.
Create a GitHub repository to host your code and share the link as instructed.
Create a small video demonstrating the hardware setup and the working of your code.
