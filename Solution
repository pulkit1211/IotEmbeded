To accomplish the given task, you can follow these steps:

Set up the Development Environment:

Choose a microcontroller platform that supports persistent storage and network communication, such as ESP32 with FreeRTOS.
Set up the necessary software development tools and libraries for your chosen microcontroller platform.
Install any required SDKs or APIs for handling network communications, persistent storage, and measuring query time.
Network Communication and Data Storage:

Use the appropriate libraries or APIs provided by the microcontroller platform to establish a network connection.
Implement logic to download the latest data from the given API when the system starts.
Store the downloaded data in persistent storage, such as an SD card.
Handle API failures by checking the response status and implementing appropriate error handling mechanisms. If the API fails, the system should use the old stored persistent data as a fallback option.
User Input and Query Processing:

Implement the functionality to accept user input (typing a key) through the console or any other input method available on your microcontroller.
Retrieve the stored data from the persistent storage based on the provided key.
Print the corresponding value to the console.
Measure the query time and print it alongside the result. You can use timers or timestamps to measure the query time.
Handle Border Cases:

Take into consideration any border cases, such as handling invalid input, handling situations where the stored data is missing or corrupted, or handling scenarios where the API response is slow.
Implement appropriate error handling and error messages to provide a robust user experience.
Testing and Documentation:

Test your code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and handle any potential issues or bugs.
Create a GitHub repository to host your code and share the link as instructed.
Make a small video demonstrating the hardware setup and the working of your code, showcasing the system starting up, querying the data, and printing the result with the query time.
